This app can be used by a pet rescue NGO to manage the adoption process. It features a tinder-style dashboard with swipeable cards that make adoption easy and fun.

## Features
Swipeable cards. These cards contain images of the pets that are available for adoption. A potential adopter can swipe right to mark a pet as a favorite or swipe left to remove it from the dashboard.

Admin Dashboard. The admin has visibility of the entire adoption process as well as all the pets available for adoption. He/She can create, edit and delete pet data on the app.
